	"Lilac is a shy, observant girl who once lived in a humble\n\ncountryside community along with her mother Primrose.\n\n\nShe was once shining with energy. Nowadays, she\n\nchannels it inward into her keenly observant and\n\noverburned mind. As timid and impressionable\n\nas Lilac might seem, a fire lies dormant in her\n\nheart that yearns to be rekindled.",
